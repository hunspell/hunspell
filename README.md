# About Hunspell

NOTICE: Version 2 is in the works. For contributing see [version 2
specification](https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/wiki/Version-2-Specification)
and the folder `src/hunspell2`.

Hunspell is a spell checker and morphological analyzer library and
program designed for languages with rich morphology and complex word
compounding or character encoding. Hunspell interfaces: Ispell-like
terminal interface using Curses library, Ispell pipe interface, C++
class and C functions.

Hunspell's code base comes from the OpenOffice.org MySpell
(http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/MySpell-3.zip). See
README.MYSPELL, AUTHORS.MYSPELL and license.myspell files. Hunspell is
designed to eventually replace Myspell in OpenOffice.org.

Main features of Hunspell spell checker and morphological analyzer:

  - Unicode support (affix rules work only with the first 65535 Unicode
    characters)
  - Morphological analysis (in custom item and arrangement style) and
    stemming
  - Max. 65535 affix classes and twofold affix stripping (for
    agglutinative languages, like Azeri, Basque, Estonian, Finnish,
    Hungarian, Turkish, etc.)
  - Support complex compounds (for example, Hungarian and German)
  - Support language specific features (for example, special casing of
    Azeri and Turkish dotted i, or German sharp s)
  - Handle conditional affixes, circumfixes, fogemorphemes, forbidden
    words, pseudoroots and homonyms.
  - Free software. Versions 1.x are licenced under LGPL, GPL, MPL
    tri-license. Version 2 is licenced only under GNU LGPL.

# Dependencies

Build only dependencies:

    g++ make autoconf automake autopoint libtool

Runtime dependencies:

|               | Mandatory |Optional|
|---------------|-----------|--------|
|libhunspell 1  |           |        |
|cmd line tool 1| libiconv  |gettext ncurses readline|
|libhunspell 2  | cppunit   |        |
|cmd line tool 2|           |        |
    
Recommended tools for developers:

    vim qtcreator clang-format cppcheck

# Compiling on GNU/Linux and Unixes

We first need to download the dependencies. On Linux, `gettext` and
`libiconv` are part of the standard library. On other Unixes we
need to manually install them.

For Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install autoconf automake autopoint libtool libcppunit-dev

Then run the following commands:

    autoreconf -vfi
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

For dictionary development, use the `--with-warnings` option of
configure.

For interactive user interface of Hunspell executable, use the
`--with-ui option`.

Optional developer packages:

  - ncurses (need for --with-ui), eg. libncursesw5 for UTF-8
  - readline (for fancy input line editing, configure parameter:
    --with-readline)
  - locale and gettext (but you can also use the --with-included-gettext
    configure parameter)

In Ubuntu, the packages are:

    libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev

# Compiling on OSX and macOS

On macOS for compiler always use `clang` and not `g++` because Homebrew
dependencies are build with that.

    brew install autoconf automake libtool gettext pkg-config cppunit
    brew link gettext --force

Then run the standard trio: autoreconf, configure, make. See above.

# Compiling on Windows

## 1\. Compiling with Mingw64 and MSYS2

Download Msys2, update everything and install the following
    packages:

    pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool mingw-w64-x86_64-cppunit

Open Mingw-w64 Win64 prompt and compile the same way as on Linux, see
above.

## 2\. Compiling in Cygwin environment

Download and install Cygwin environment for Windows with the following
extra packages:

  - make
  - automake
  - autoconf
  - libtool
  - gcc-g++ development package
  - ncurses, readline (for user interface)
  - iconv (character conversion)

Then compile the same way as on Linux. Cygwin builds depend on
Cygwin1.dll.

# Debugging

It is recomended to install a debug build of the standard library:

    libstdc++6-6-dbg

For debugging we need to create a debug build and then we need to start
`gdb`.

    ./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O0 -Wall -Wextra'
    make
    libtool --mode=execute gdb src/tools/hunspell

You can also pass the `CXXFLAGS` directly to `make` without calling
`./configure`, but we don't recommend this way during long development
sessions.

If you like to develop and debug with an IDE, see documentation at
https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/wiki/IDE-Setup

# Testing

Testing Hunspell (see tests in tests/ subdirectory):

    make check

or with Valgrind debugger:

    make check
    VALGRIND=[Valgrind_tool] make check

For example:

    make check
    VALGRIND=memcheck make check

# Documentation

features and dictionary format:

    man 5 hunspell
    man hunspell
    hunspell -h

http://hunspell.github.io/

# Usage

The src/tools directory contains ten executables after compiling.

  - The main executable:
      - hunspell: main program for spell checking and others (see
        manual)
  - Example tools:
      - analyze: example of spell checking, stemming and morphological
        analysis
      - chmorph: example of automatic morphological generation and
        conversion
      - example: example of spell checking and suggestion
  - Tools for dictionary development:
      - affixcompress: dictionary generation from large (millions of
        words) vocabularies
      - makealias: alias compression (Hunspell only, not back compatible
        with MySpell)
      - wordforms: word generation (Hunspell version of unmunch)
      - hunzip: decompressor of hzip format
      - hzip: compressor of hzip format
      - munch (DEPRECATED, use affixcompress): dictionary generation
        from vocabularies (it needs an affix file, too).
      - unmunch (DEPRECATED, use wordforms): list all recognized words
        of a MySpell dictionary

After compiling and installing (see INSTALL) you can run the Hunspell
spell checker (compiled with user interface) with a Hunspell or Myspell
dictionary:

    hunspell -d en_US text.txt

or without interface:

    hunspell
    hunspell -d en_UK -l <text.txt

Dictionaries consist of an affix and dictionary file, see tests/ or
http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries.

# Using Hunspell library with GCC

Including in your program:

    #include <hunspell.hxx>

Linking with Hunspell static library:

``` 
g++ -lhunspell example.cxx 
```
